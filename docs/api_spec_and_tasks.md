## Full API spec
```python

openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: IP Location API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /location:
    post:
      summary: Get the geographical location of an IP address.

```

## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the Flask application and the /location endpoint. It uses the IPGeolocation class from ip_location.py."),
    ("ip_location.py", "Contains the IPGeolocation class that uses the 'ip2geotools' library to get the location of an IP address."),
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "ip_location.py",
    "main.py",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'ip2geotools' library is used to get the geographical location of an IP address. It is used in the IPGeolocation class in 'ip_location.py'.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. The only potential challenge is handling various edge cases, such as invalid IP addresses or issues with the 'ip2geotools' library. However, these can be handled with proper error handling and validation.
