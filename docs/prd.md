## Original Requirements
The boss has requested for the creation of a simple API that can provide the location (city) of an IP address given in a POST request. The API should be written in Go and a README with a quickstart guide should be provided.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a simple and efficient API that can provide the location of an IP address",
    "Ensure the API is written in Go",
    "Provide a README with a quickstart guide for easy usage of the API"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to input an IP address and get the location (city) in return",
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily understand how to use the API through a README",
    "As a developer, I want to be able to use the API in my Go applications"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "IP Geolocation API: Provides location data for IP addresses but does not provide a Go-specific implementation",
    "IP-API: Provides comprehensive IP address data but lacks a Go-specific implementation",
    "IPinfo.io: Offers a Go library for IP data, but usage is complex and not beginner-friendly",
    "IPStack: Provides extensive IP data but lacks a Go-specific implementation and is not beginner-friendly",
    "GeoIP2: Offers a Go library for IP data but lacks simplicity in usage"
]
```

```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a simple and efficient API written in Go that takes an IP address as input and returns the location (city) of the IP address. The API should be easy to use and understand, with a README provided for a quickstart guide.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Develop an API that takes an IP address as input and returns the location", "P0"),
    ("Ensure the API is written in Go", "P0"),
    ("Create a README with a quickstart guide for the API", "P0")
]
```

## UI Design draft
As this is an API, there will be no user interface. However, the API should be designed to be simple and easy to use. The README should be clear and concise, providing a step-by-step guide on how to use the API.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.
